# IOT-in-agriculture-smart-monitoring-system

The main aim of this project is to prevent the loss of crops and protect the area from intruders of animals and human thief which pose a major threat to the agricultural areas.

 The provided a code snippet written in Python using the OpenCV and Flask libraries, and some other libraries as well. The code appears to be detecting motion 
 and capturing images using a camera module. It also uses machine learning techniques to classify objects in the captured images. 
 Here's what the code does:
 * It imports required libraries such as imutils, numpy, socket, threading, argparse, datetime, cv2, RPi.GPIO, and twilio.
 * It defines some constants such as GET_IP_CMD, LED, BUZZER, and PIR.
 * It initializes some variables such as number, capture, detection, detected, outputFrame, motionoutput, and lock.
 * It creates an argument parser and parses command-line arguments.
 * It creates a Flask application and starts a video stream.
 * It defines a route for the index page and provides functionality for capturing images, detecting motion, and controlling a buzzer.
 * It defines a function to detect motion and classify objects in the captured images. It loads a pre-trained machine learning model using the MobileNet SSD        framework, loops over frames from the video stream, and uses the model to detect objects in the frames.
 * It checks if motion is detected using a PIR sensor, captures images if motion is detected, and classifies objects in the captured images.
 * If an object of interest is detected, it sends a notification and turns on a buzzer and an LED for 5 seconds.
